## 2026-02-03 - Information Leakage in Exception Handling
**Vulnerability:** The application was catching all exceptions and returning their string representation (`str(e)`) directly to the client in the HTTP 500 response. This could expose sensitive internal details (stack traces, database info, file paths).
**Learning:** Developers often pass `str(e)` to `HTTPException` for convenience during debugging, but this practice frequently makes it into production code, leading to information leakage.
**Prevention:** In production, catch `Exception` and raise `HTTPException` with a generic message (e.g., "Internal Server Error"). Ensure full exception details are logged using `logger.exception()` for server-side debugging.
