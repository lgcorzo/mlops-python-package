## 2026-02-03 - Information Leakage in Exception Handling
**Vulnerability:** The application was catching all exceptions and returning their string representation (`str(e)`) directly to the client in the HTTP 500 response. This could expose sensitive internal details (stack traces, database info, file paths).
**Learning:** Developers often pass `str(e)` to `HTTPException` for convenience during debugging, but this practice frequently makes it into production code, leading to information leakage.
**Prevention:** In production, catch `Exception` and raise `HTTPException` with a generic message (e.g., "Internal Server Error"). Ensure full exception details are logged using `logger.exception()` for server-side debugging.

## 2026-02-05 - Information Leakage in Kafka Consumer
**Vulnerability:** The Kafka consumer and prediction callback were catching exceptions and embedding the raw exception message `str(e)` into the response payload sent to the output topic.
**Learning:** Even asynchronous background workers (like Kafka consumers) can leak information if they reflect input processing errors back to an output channel without sanitization.
**Prevention:** Use a dedicated `PredictionService` wrapper that catches exceptions, logs the full stack trace securely, and returns a generic "Internal Processing Error" message to the output topic.

## 2026-03-04 - Information Leakage in Application Error Fields
**Vulnerability:** The application was catching exceptions in logic callbacks and Kafka consumers, then assigning the raw exception string to a JSON `error` field in the successful response object. This leaked internal details even when the HTTP status code was 200 OK or when processing asynchronously via Kafka.
**Learning:** Checking for HTTP 500 handlers is not enough. Review application-level error handling where business logic manually constructs error objects.
**Prevention:** Ensure that any `result["error"]` or similar fields populated in catch blocks use generic messages, while the real exception is logged server-side.

## 2026-06-18 - Insecure Default CORS Configuration
**Vulnerability:** The application was missing explicit CORS and TrustedHost middleware, potentially exposing it to Host Header Injection and unauthorized cross-origin access.
**Learning:** Defaulting to `allow_credentials=True` with `allow_origins=["*"]` is a common mistake that browsers reject. Safe defaults must ensure credentials are disabled if wildcard origins are used.
**Prevention:** Implement conditional logic to force `allow_credentials=False` when `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` contains `*`, ensuring the application remains functional and spec-compliant by default.
